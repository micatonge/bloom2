<h2 style="font-family:sans-serif;font-size: 140%;margin-top:-60px"> Mental health is important throughout your entire life. It includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects the way we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Some factors that contribute to mental health problems are: biological factors, life experience, and family history of mental health problems. There is a large stigma around talking about mental health. Though we cannot see mental illnesses, that does not mean that they do not exist. Nearly 60% of adults with a mental illness did not recieve mental health services in the previous year. That is a statistic that needs to change, and the first step is becoming educated. Fear of mental illnesses stems from the fear of not knowing. Nothing is more powerful than knowing, and becoming educated will enable you to no longer fear the unknown of mental illness.</h2>
