<h1> SKINCARE MISCONCEPTIONS <h1>
</div>
<div class= "misconceptions">
<ol type="I">
  <li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Vitamin E minimizes scarring.</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>
Vitamin E is an antioxidant and helps build skin, but there is no evidence that it does anything to help with scarring. There is even some research that suggests it may have a negative effect on scarring.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Cucumbers help reduce puffiness around the eyes.</li>
  <ol type="i">
<li>
The principle ingredient in cucumbers is 90% water with the balance being inert fiber. Although cucumbers are mostly used in spas for facial treatments and can be soothing and hydrate skin temporarily. The same results can be obtained from a cold compress.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Skin pores open and close.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
Pores are openings in the skin that allow oils to reach the surface. It is not possible for them to open and close on their own. If pores are larger, this can be due to dead cells, genetics or scarring from squeezing blemishes.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">The higher the skin protection factor (SPF) rating, the better.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
  SPF ratings only refer to protection from UVB rays. A person needs sun protection that has chemical and physical blockers, plus antioxidants. A higher SPF also gives a false sense of security and introduces more potentially harmful chemicals to the body.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Layering several products with SPF ratings increases protection.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
  You are only protected to the extent of the higher rating of one product. A foundation with an SPF of 10, moisturizer with an SPF of 15 and a sunscreen with an SPF of 20 does not yield an SPF rating of 45.
</li>
</ol >
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Topical creams containing collagen can replace collagen.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
There is no evidence that the topical application of collagen or elastin can penetrate the dermis, even when using tech­nology. They can provide moisturi­zation to the epidermis, but only injections are effective.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Mineral oil is bad for your skin.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
Mineral oil is a far from the industrial type that was used on skin back in the day. It's a very effective ingredient in helping remove excess oil from the skin. Vitamin A is the best ingredient to normalize skin.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Mineral oil is comedogenic.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
Cosmeceutical-grade mineral oil is not comedogenic. The myth is that industrial-grade mineral oil and lubricants are the same as those used in cosmetic ingredients. So-called medicinal white mineral oil has met with stringent safety standards. To remove sebum plugs in the follicles, an oil-based substance is needed. Water-based products cannot melt or remove sebum plugs.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Preservatives in skin care products are bad.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
Preservatives help prevent the growth of bacteria, fungi and other organisms that can not only deteriorate a product’s effectiveness and spoil the product itself, but also allow harmful bacteria to get on or in the skin. Parabens are found throughout nature; for example, many fruits and vegetables are naturally full of parabens
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Packaging is not important.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
Packaging in skin care is vitally important—not for aesthetic reasons—but to protect the efficacy of the ingredients. Wide-mouth jars, transparent containers and pumps that are not airless all pose problems in keeping ingredients safe and potent.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Chocolate and greasy foods cause acne.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
Eating chocolate does not cause acne. Hormonal factors, bacteria and skin cells are at the root of problematic skin, and stress can exacerbate flareups. Some individuals may have allergic reactions to foods that can cause inflammation, as well.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Natural and organic products are always better.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
 Many natural and organic products are not as they claim. Plus, many times, active ingredients have to be synthesized to be bioavailable and efficacious. Synthetic compounds can actually be identical to those found in nature and be more effective. Natural vs. laboratory-processed should not lead to an up or down decision about whether a product is good or bad. Not all chemicals are bad, and not all natural or organic ingredients are good.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Using larger quantities of a product will yield better results.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
Less is more. Normally, a pea-sized amount of facial product will do the trick. Excessive amounts can cause skin problems and waste money.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Blackheads are a caused by improperly cleansed skin.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
Blackheads or comedones are caused by clogged pores, and excessive scrubbing can irritate and further inflame skin. Blackheads often contain dirt, oil, and dry and dead skin cells that need to be removed. Products that help dissolve sebum are the most effective.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Drying problematic or oily skin clears up acne.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
The opposite is true. When skin becomes overly dry, an environment is created in which the skin is signaled that is too dry and produces more oil. Use drying products sparingly, and look to lightly moisture oily skin. The goal is to keep skin balanced.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Get a base tan to prevent burning before going on vacation.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
Any tan is a scar, and there is no such thing as a healthy, safe tan. Self-tanners are the safest way to obtain tanned skin.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">All sun damage to skin occurs before 18 years of age.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
Sun damage continues to occur throughout life, although recent information suggests less than 50% of sun damage happens before a person is 18.2 It is never too late to protect your skin.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Indoor tanning is safe.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
The argument that tanning beds and booths do not cause skin mutations that may cause cancerous lesions to develop is patently false. UVA rays found in indoor tanning lead to deeper, more harmful skin damage. You do not have to have a sunburn to create damage to skin cells.
</li>
</ol>
<li class="titlelists" style="font-weight:bold">Antioxidants reverse wrinkles.</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
Antioxidants are essential in fighting free radical formation and are important in helping prevent skin damage, but they cannot make wrinkles go away.
</li>
<ol type="i">
</ol>
