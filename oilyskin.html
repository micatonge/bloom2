<h1> OILY</h1>
<center>
<h2> ABOUT OILY SKIN </h2>
</center>

<div class="aboutoilyskin">
<p1>Oily skin is caused by excess skin oil produced within the pores. The primary test for determining if you have oily skin is when you start to feel some oil on your face. Most people can feel a little oil by late afternoon, but if you feel oil around midday, you have oily skin. Oily skin rarely reacts negatively to skin products like dry, sensitive skin types do. It has slightly better natural sun protection, but is also prone to acne.</p1>

<div class="treatments">
  <h3> HOMEMADE TREATMENTS </h3>
<ol type="I">
  <li style="font-weight:bold"> Tomatoes </li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li> Tomatoes are great for oily skin due to their cooling and clarifying properties. The high vitamin C content in tomatoes is very helpful for acne-prone skin. Plus, the natural oil-absorbing acids in tomatoes help get rid of excess oil. </li>
    <li> Combine 1 teaspoon sugar with the pulp of 1 tomato.Then apply it to your skin and wait for 5 minutes. Rinse it off with water and pat dry. You can also use a moisturizer after. </li>
  </ol>
   <li style="font-weight:bold">Apples </li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>Apples work as a great exfoliating agent and they have mild antiseptic and soothing properties that make them a great home remedy for oily skin. The malic acid in apples helps exfoliate dead skin cells and absorbs excess oil from the skinâ€™s surface.</li>
   <li>Grate half an apple and place the shreds on your skin. Leave it on the skin for 15 minutes and then wash it off with water.
Mix one teaspoon each of grated apple, yogurt and lemon juice to form a smooth paste. Apply it all over your face and leave it on for 15 minutes. Then rinse your face with cool water.
</li>
 </ol>
    <li style="font-weight:bold"> Clay Mask </li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li> Mud or clay pack helps in removing the excess oil, restricts oil production and gets rid off impurities.</li>
    <li> Make a mask by thoroughly mixing 2 tbsp. of witch hazel, 1 tbsp. of facial clay and a couple of drops each of lemon and cypress oil for aroma. Let it sit for 10 minutes and after it dries wash it off with cold water.li>
  </ol>
  <li style="font-weight:bold">Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li> Apple cider vinegar is rich in alpha hydroxyl sources which moisturize and tone the skin. The antibacterial properties of acv fight with the bacteria causing acne. If you don't have apple cider vinegar then you can use white vinegar instead. White vinegar exfoliates and controls the oil production.</li>
  <li>You can make a homemade toner by diluting one-fourth cup of apple cider vinegar with three-fourths cup of distilled water. Apply this toner on your skin using a cotton ball. Leave it on for five to 10 minutes. Then rinse it off with cool water. Do this several times a week to see positive results.</li>
  </ol>
</div>





<div class= "prevention">
  <h6> PREVENTION </h6>
<ol type="I">
  <li style="font-weight:bold"> Wash your face twice a day with a gentle face cleanser. </li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li> This will remove the excess oil that's clogging your pores. Using a basic face cleanser every morning and night is the best way to prevent oily skin.</li>
    </ol>
  <li style="font-weight:bold">Apply toner to tighten your pores and remove oil.</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li> There are many kinds of toner. Use either an astringent or freshener to fight oily skin. Stay away from skin tonics and skin bracers because they are only for normal or dry skin </li>
  </ol>
  <li style="font-weight:bold">Use blotting paper and carry medicated pads for quick and easy oil reduction. </li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>Blotting paper is great because it doesn't dry out skin and it only takes 15 to 20 seconds. Medicated pads usually have salicylic acid or glycolic acid and are easy to use on the go. Since they're acid-based they're a great treatment for acne too.</li>
  </ol>
  <li style="font-weight:bold">Use oil-free moisturizers and oil-free sunscreen. </li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li> Read the ingredients carefully on any products you use. Choose only the ones that are water-based and noncomedogenic. </li>
  </ol>
  <li style="font-weight:bold">Use a deep cleaning facial mask as needed to remove excess oil.</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li> Facial masks give you a deeper cleanse than an ordinary face wash. They go deeper to remove impurities and draw out the oil in your pores. However, there is a greater risk for over drying with facial masks. Don't use them often!</li>
  </ol>
  <li style="font-weight:bold"> Wear the Correct Kind of Makeup </li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>Read the ingredients list to make sure your cosmetics are oil-free and noncomedogenic. Try a mineral powder or water-based foundation, and powder blush and eye shadow rather than creams. And remember to wash off all of your makeup before going to bed.</li>
  </ol>
<li style="font-weight:bold"> Keep Oil Away from Your Face </li>
<ol type="i">
  <li>Keep your hands and hair off of your face as both carry naturally occurring oils. Also make sure to clean your cellphone or telephone with an alcohol wipe daily.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
