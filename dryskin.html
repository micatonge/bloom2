<h2> ABOUT DRY SKIN! </h2>
</center>
<div class="aboutdryskin">
<p1>Dry Skin does not have the tendency to lock in natural mositure and oils so when you have dry skin, your pores are literally almost invisible. It may seem like you have a rough complexion and red patches as well less elasticity on your skin.
    Sometimes your skin can easily crack, peel, flake, or become itchy, but this isn’t always the case. The major key needed to maintain dry skin is moisture, moisture, and lots of moisture.</p1>

  <h3> HOMEMADE TREATMENTS </h3>
<ol type="I">
  <li style="font-weight:bold"> Honey Revitalizing Balm </li>
  <ol>
    <li> Traditionally, honey has always been an important part of skin care. It is a natural humectant, so it keeps your skin moisturized. Honey, when used along with beeswax and olive oil, can help combat dry skin and conditions associated with it </li>
    <li>Melt beeswax in a double boiler. After the beeswax is heated, add olive oil and hoeny to it and mix. Pour it in a jar quick before it starts to solidfy.
If you want you can add two tablespoons of orange juice for added skin cleansing benefits. </li>
  </ol>
   <li style="font-weight:bold">Oatmeal Mosturizing Mask</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Oatmeal is one of the most effective home remedies for dry skin on the face. It also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which help you deal with the symptoms that dry skin causes </li>
   <li>Warm up milk in a saucepan.Place oatmeal in a bowl, and add the milk to it.
     Wait for a few minutes before adding honey. When you finish, apply the face mask and keep it on for at least 20 minutes.
Rins the mask off with cold water.
</li>
 </ol>
    <li style="font-weight:bold">Chocolate Pack </li>
  <ol>
    <li> Chocolate, apart from being one of the most sought after confectioneries, also has many benefits for the skin. Lathering molten chocolate onto dry skin makes the skin soft and glowing.</li>
    <li> Mix cocoa powder, honey, maize flour, and mashed avocado thoroughly to make a smooth paste. Apply this pack onto your dry skin and leave it on for half an hour.
After waiting, rinse with lukewarm water.</li>
  </ol>
  <li style="font-weight:bold"> Yougurt</li>
  <ol>
    <li> Yogurt is an excellent skin-hydrating agent. Plus, its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties help soothe dry and itchy skin. Also, its lactic acid content helps get rid of any germs or bacteria that may cause dryness or itchiness.</li>
  <li> Apply fresh yogurt on your hands, face and legs and gently massaging it into your skin. Leave it on for 10 minutes and then take a bath or shower. The mild exfoliating action of yogurt will remove dry skin and leave your skin refreshed. </li>
  </ol>

<div class= "prevention">
  <h6> PREVENTION </h6>
<ol type="I">
  <li style="font-weight:bold"> Petroleum jelly </li>
    <ol>
      <li> petroleum jelly products can heal skin in older adults. Petroleum jelly, also known as mineral oil, covers the skin in a protective layer. It traps moisture underneath. This helps heal dry, irritated skin patches. </li>
    </ol>
  <li style="font-weight:bold">Insulated gloves</li>
  <ol>
    <li> Wearing insulated gloves while doing household chores, or when you’re outside in extreme temperatures can cut down on dry, irritated skin. </li>
  </ol>
  <li style="font-weight:bold"> Use a humidifier </li>
  <ol>
    <li>Keeping a humidifier in your home can help minimize the dryness caused by home heating systems.  </li>
  </ol>
  <li style="font-weight:bold">Adjust your shower temperature</li>
  <ol>
    <li>While most people tend to take hot showers, these can scald the skin and cause damage. And some soaps that claim to moisturize and repair the skin can cause the opposite effect. They can trigger allergic reactions and make the skin thinner with harsh chemicals. Take short showers with water that’s warm, not hot. And look for soaps that are fragrance-free and gentler on skin than traditional soaps. </li>
  </ol>
  <li style="font-weight:bold">Avoid allergens and irritants</li>
  <ol>
    <li> petroleum jelly products can heal skin in older adults. Petroleum jelly, also known as mineral oil, covers the skin in a protective layer. It traps moisture underneath. This helps heal dry, irritated skin patches. </li>
  </ol>
  <li style="font-weight:bold"> Antioxidants </li>
  <ol>
    <li>Foods rich in antioxidants can minimize damage from toxins and help your body make healthy cells. Some of the foods that contribute to skin health include:
blueberries, tomatoes, carrots, beans, peas, avocados, and lentils </li>
  </ol>
<li style="font-weight:bold"> Apply products with hyaluronic acid. </li>
<ol>
  <li>The other thing that can go on underneath a moisturizer is a hyaluronic acid product. That molecule is very hydroscopic — it pulls water in around it. That would be a great augmenting moisturizer for someone with dry skin.</li>
</ol>
<!--
<li> Proceed with caution.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>It helps to take your time adding new products to your skin care routine. Try them one at a time and wait to see if you get a reaction before adding another new product. </li>
</ol> -->
